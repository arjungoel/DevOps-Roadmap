`cat /etc/shells` -> this command will show the list of shells available on your system and you can use any of them.
`which bash` -> this command will tell you the path of the bash.
`chmod +x <file_name>` -> this command is used to make your bash script executable.
`./<file_name>` -> this command is used to execute your file.
